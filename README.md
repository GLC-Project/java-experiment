GoldCoin (gldcoin.com) Version 2.0 Pre-Alpha/Development

Notes:

This software is incomplete, and is not suitable for a production environment.

I may have inadvertently missed some attribution tags in some places. 
Please wait until I have confirmed that they are all in their proper place before using this code in any other project.

Some values are hard-coded and need to be made dynamic, over all this is a work in progress and please treat it as such.
